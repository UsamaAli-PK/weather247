# AI Predictions and Historical Data Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of AI-powered weather predictions, historical data visualization, and advanced analytics for Weather247 platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Historical Weather Data Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view historical weather trends over the past 5 years, so that I can understand long-term weather patterns and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests historical data THEN the system SHALL provide weather trends for the past 5 years
2. WHEN storing weather data THEN the system SHALL automatically archive data older than 30 days to historical tables
3. WHEN displaying historical trends THEN the system SHALL show temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind patterns
4. WHEN historical data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate data gaps clearly to users
5. WHEN aggregating historical data THEN the system SHALL provide daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries

### Requirement 2: Interactive Historical Charts

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visualize weather trends through interactive charts, so that I can easily identify patterns and anomalies in historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL display interactive line charts with zoom and pan capabilities
2. WHEN selecting time ranges THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by custom date ranges, seasons, and years
3. WHEN hovering over chart points THEN the system SHALL show detailed weather information for that specific date
4. WHEN comparing metrics THEN the system SHALL allow overlay of multiple weather parameters on the same chart
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide options to download charts as images and data as CSV

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered 24-Hour Predictions

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate AI-generated weather predictions for the next 24 hours, so that I can plan my activities with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting predictions THEN the system SHALL generate 24-hour forecasts using machine learning models
2. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL show confidence intervals for each prediction
3. WHEN training AI models THEN the system SHALL use at least 30 days of historical data for each location
4. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL update them every 6 hours with new data
5. WHEN model accuracy drops THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models with recent data

### Requirement 4: Weather Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a meteorologist, I want the system to identify weather patterns and anomalies, so that I can better understand climate trends and make professional assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing historical data THEN the system SHALL identify recurring weather patterns and seasonal trends
2. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL highlight unusual weather events and extreme conditions
3. WHEN comparing years THEN the system SHALL show year-over-year changes and climate trends
4. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis of weather patterns
5. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL create automated reports for professional users

### Requirement 5: Predictive Model Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage and monitor AI prediction models, so that I can ensure optimal performance and accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL track model performance metrics and accuracy scores
2. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger retraining processes
3. WHEN managing models THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing of different prediction algorithms
4. WHEN storing models THEN the system SHALL version control all model artifacts and training data
5. WHEN monitoring predictions THEN the system SHALL log all prediction requests and actual outcomes for validation
