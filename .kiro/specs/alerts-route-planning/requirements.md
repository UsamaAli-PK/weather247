# Weather Alerts and Route Planning Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of intelligent weather alerts, SMS/email notifications, and weather-aware route planning for Weather247 platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Weather Alert System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive timely alerts for severe weather conditions, so that I can take appropriate safety measures and adjust my plans accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN severe weather is detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts within 5 minutes of detection
2. WHEN configuring alerts THEN users SHALL be able to set custom thresholds for temperature, wind, precipitation, and air quality
3. WHEN sending alerts THEN the system SHALL support both SMS and email delivery methods
4. WHEN weather conditions improve THEN the system SHALL send "all clear" notifications to users
5. WHEN multiple alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single comprehensive message

### Requirement 2: Alert Customization and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my alert preferences for different locations and weather conditions, so that I receive only relevant notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up alerts THEN users SHALL be able to configure different thresholds for each monitored city
2. WHEN managing notifications THEN users SHALL be able to choose delivery methods (SMS, email, push notifications)
3. WHEN scheduling alerts THEN users SHALL be able to set quiet hours and delivery preferences
4. WHEN receiving alerts THEN users SHALL be able to snooze or dismiss notifications
5. WHEN alert history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide a log of all sent alerts with timestamps

### Requirement 3: Smart Route Planning

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want weather-aware route suggestions, so that I can choose the best path considering current and forecasted weather conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning a route THEN the system SHALL display weather conditions along the entire path
2. WHEN weather hazards exist THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative routes with better conditions
3. WHEN displaying routes THEN the system SHALL show estimated travel time considering weather impacts
4. WHEN severe weather is on the route THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and safety recommendations
5. WHEN routes are saved THEN users SHALL be able to monitor weather conditions for future trips

### Requirement 4: Interactive Route Weather Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see weather conditions visualized on an interactive map along my route, so that I can make informed decisions about my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a route THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map with weather overlays
2. WHEN hovering over route segments THEN the system SHALL show detailed weather information for that location
3. WHEN weather conditions change THEN the system SHALL update the route visualization in real-time
4. WHEN planning multi-day trips THEN the system SHALL show weather forecasts for each day of travel
5. WHEN sharing routes THEN users SHALL be able to export route weather information

### Requirement 5: Alert Intelligence and Machine Learning

**User Story:** As a system, I want to learn from user behavior and weather patterns, so that I can provide more accurate and relevant alerts over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with alerts THEN the system SHALL track response patterns to improve relevance
2. WHEN weather patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest alert threshold adjustments
3. WHEN false alerts occur THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust sensitivity to reduce noise
4. WHEN seasonal patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adapt alert timing and content accordingly
5. WHEN user location changes THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest relevant alert configurations

### Requirement 6: Emergency Weather Notifications

**User Story:** As a safety-conscious user, I want immediate notifications for life-threatening weather conditions, so that I can take emergency protective actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate high-priority alerts
2. WHEN emergency alerts are sent THEN they SHALL bypass user quiet hours and delivery preferences
3. WHEN multiple emergency conditions exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize by severity level
4. WHEN emergency conditions persist THEN the system SHALL send periodic updates every 30 minutes
5. WHEN emergency conditions end THEN the system SHALL send immediate "all clear" notifications
