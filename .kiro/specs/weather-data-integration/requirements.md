# Weather Data Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of real-time weather data integration, historical data storage, and comprehensive weather API management for Weather247 platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Weather Data Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view current weather conditions for multiple cities, so that I can make informed decisions based on real-time data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a city THEN the system SHALL display current temperature, humidity, and AQI within 2 seconds
2. WHEN weather data is older than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch fresh data from APIs
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a "last updated" timestamp
4. WHEN displaying weather data THEN the system SHALL show temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility, and AQI
5. WHEN weather conditions change significantly THEN the system SHALL update the display automatically

### Requirement 2: Multi-City Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor weather conditions for at least 3 cities simultaneously, so that I can compare conditions across different locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display weather data for at least 3 cities by default
2. WHEN a user adds a new city THEN the system SHALL validate the city exists and add it to their watchlist
3. WHEN displaying multiple cities THEN the system SHALL show all cities in a responsive grid layout
4. WHEN a user removes a city THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
5. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL support up to 10 cities per user

### Requirement 3: Weather API Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to integrate multiple weather APIs, so that the system has reliable data sources with fallback options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary API (OpenWeatherMap) is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to secondary APIs
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to stay within API quotas
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data before storage
4. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL store them securely using environment variables
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4: Data Caching and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast loading weather data, so that I can quickly access the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather data is requested THEN the system SHALL serve cached data if it's less than 15 minutes old
2. WHEN caching weather data THEN the system SHALL implement Redis caching for optimal performance
3. WHEN the cache is full THEN the system SHALL implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
4. WHEN serving cached data THEN the system SHALL include cache timestamps in API responses
5. WHEN background updates occur THEN the system SHALL refresh cache without blocking user requests
